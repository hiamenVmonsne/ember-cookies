> "Who says falling in love is easy? Apart from parents and religion, throw in your own nature and see how, by merely being yourself, the journey of true love can get more complicated. Full marks to him [Gautham Menon] for revealing to us a classy Simbu we never thought existed, and for pulling off superb chemistry between him and Trisha. Itâs a performance-packed role for Trisha, and she does a neat job." - Bhama Devi Ravi, Times of India

> "VINNAITHAANDI VARUVAAYAA has a great soundtrack and at times, it also manages to express that heartbreak of first love. Overall, however, it remains simply too superficial for my taste and the excessive runtime is also not doing it any favors." - Jimmy Cage, Jimmy Cage Movie Reviews (YouTube)

As you can see, the reviews are mixed, with some praising the film for its realistic portrayal of love and its lead performances, while others criticizing it for its lack of depth and length. However, most agree that the film has a memorable music score by A.R. Rahman, who won several awards for his work.
 
So, if you are looking for a romantic film that will make you feel the highs and lows of love, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa might be the one for you. Just make sure you have enough time and patience to watch it till the end.
